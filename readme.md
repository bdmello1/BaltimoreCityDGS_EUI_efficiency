# Baltimore City DGS - EUI Efficiency Status and Reccomendations March,2020


## Problem Statement
How energy efficient are Baltimore city buildings split by size, sector, and age and of the buildings under Baltimore City control, what measures can be taken to create energy-efficient solutions? 

## Background and Motivation
Baltimore City DGS is interested for three reasons
1. Efficiency
a. FY19 Spend on utilities =  19M 
b. Energy consumption from buildings makes up the largest amount of spend coming from utilities 
c. Address which set of buildings/areas are spending the most per sqft and have highest EUI also address lowest EUI + outliers

2. Fiscally
3. Sustainability

## Impact of Findings


## Recommendations 
Baltimore City needs to take steps to reduce energy efficiency and follow model cities which aim to have a goal of cutting carbon emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2020. To achieve these goals it is important to first target buildings/ sites that have a high EUI due to inefficient use. The following will lay the next step both in the short and long term to cut unnecessary energy use and save money.
