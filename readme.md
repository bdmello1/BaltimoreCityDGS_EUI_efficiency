# 2020 Baltimore City Building EUI Analysis with ST & LT ROI

## Summary 
Baltimore City is one of the more efficient cities in the nation, however bleeds money in inefficient energy use in many building spaces. Areas of focus are amongst the police department, warehouse and storage spaces as well as museums. Solutions with quick 2-3 yr ROI are to invest in high speed doors in warehouses and energy saving lighting controls and long term solutions are to retrofit Heat Mirror windows in high EUI spaces which are buildings 50+ years in age.  

## Problem Statement
How energy efficient are Baltimore city buildings split by size, sector, and age and of the buildings under Baltimore City control, what measures can be taken to create energy-efficient solutions? 

## Background and Motivation
Baltimore City DGS is interested for three reasons. One, efficiency, fiscally, and sustainability. In FY19 Baltimore City spent 19M on utilities and found that buildings made up the largest amount of energy consumption. The goal is to reduce the spend on energy as well as decrease the carbon footprint. 

## Geospatial Analysis
The first analysis we conducted here was a simple heat map visualization of the 2019 Source EUI for Baltimore buildings, overlaid with council district boundaries. The resulting visualization is displayed below. The main takeaway here is that council districts 11 and 12 have the highest reported Source EUI in 2019. This is self-explanatory as the Downtown/Inner Harbor region contains the highest density of DGS owned and operated buildings as well as the greatest population density with regards to workforce. As such, this was a good logic check to better inform our analysis down the line.

During the data cleaning and analysis process, one key metric we wanted to calculate was the percent change in source and site EUI from 2017 to 2019. One thing to note here is that only half of the fiscal year’s data was available for the 2017 and 2019 fiscal years. As such, it is important to take these results with a grain of salt. Looking at all the buildings in Baltimore, only one building demonstrated a positive percent change in Source EUI, meaning that it was the only building whose source EUI increased over the three fiscal years. This was the Baltimore City Police Department in the Northwestern District. Amongst all the police departments in Baltimore City, this was the only one which shows an increase in Source EUI. Coincidentally, this is also the largest police department in Baltimore City by square footage. The interesting thing here was that in terms of raw Source EUI, this department showed among the lowest. However, it is still important to understand why the Source EUI has increased by almost 20%.

At the same time, we also wanted to take a look at Site EUI percent change. Aside form the previously mentioned police department, only 2 other buildings demonstrate a positive change in Source EUI from 2017 to 2019. First is the Carroll Mansion Museum. This was built in 1812, so the increase in EUI could simply result from needing to update the HVAC unit on site. The other building is the Eastside Career Center. The percent change here is not large, but still it is something to consider as the building was only built in 1955. It is also important to note that almost all buildings built after 1970 have a negative change in Source and Site EUI, so they are definitely doing something right.

## Impact of Findings


## Recommendations 
Baltimore City needs to take steps to reduce energy efficiency and follow model cities which aim to have a goal of cutting carbon emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2020. To achieve these goals it is important to first target buildings/ sites that have a high EUI due to inefficient use. The following will lay the next steps both in the short and long term to cut unnecessary energy use and save money.

### Short Term - doors on loading dock entrances
#### Option 1 - High speed doors at loading docks
Audit all garages, warehouses and self storage locations to identify if exterior envelope is leaking cooled interior air. Multiple locations have loading docks which are open to the elements and simply need a shutter/ door that can go up/ down when necessary. If this solution is implemented can see energy savings between $700-4k with an ROI in 2 years. The spaces will notice an energy use decrease between 20-30%.  

Recommended company to seal areas: RiteHite - door called (FasTrax High Speed Door)
Initial area to target based on analysis: 
Northeast DGS Fleet Substation Garage
DGS Public Building Maintenance Garage

#### Option 2 - Wireless Lighting Control
With the lights on 24x7 and significant daylight available on the upper levels, a lighting control system can help cut energy use up to 40%. This can happen by controlling lights in the daylit perimeter areas of the upper levels in response to changing daylight levels. A simple device can be installed and Baltimore City can see an ROI within 2 years.

Initial area to target based on analysis: Parking Authority Offices

### Long Term 
The best way to reduce energy use in buildings is to seal the envalope of the building. Meaning that air from the outside should not enter the building, nor should the air from inside escape. This long term strategy will yeild major saving however has an ROI of 10 years on buildings aged 50+ years. The most cost effective solution is to retrofit all windows of these buildings with a new technology called Heat Mirror®. The initial building to target is the MECU building. 

## Conclusion 
Overall, there are three strategies to reduce energy use amongst high EUI Baltimore city buildings. The first short term solutions are to seal loading dock entrances and have efficient lighting systems in garages. The long term solution is to retrofit all windows of 50+ year old buildings which may be leaking cooled air. Furthermore, it is important to identify which HVAC systems lead to highest ROI and understand why the DOT main building has the highest EUI with such a small sqft.
